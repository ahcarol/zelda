          1. Have your <i>Breath of the Wild</i> save handy for free horses
        </h1>

        <p>
          If <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i> detects a
          <i>Breath of the Wild</i> save, it‚Äôll pull the horses you had stabled
          in that game, and bring them over to Tears intact ‚Äì after all, this is
          the same Hyrule.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Not only is it a nice little touch, it also saves you the immense
          hassle of having to capture a fresh horse in the field, break it in,
          and build up your relationship with it. If you had a horse with great
          stats in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>, you‚Äôre going to want to bring it
          over.

        <h1>2. Go out of your way to collect arrows</h1>
        <div>
          <img src="./assets/arcos.webp" alt="imagem arcos" />
        </div>
        <small><i>Image: GamesHub via Nintendo</i></small>
        <p>
          Bows and arrows are more important than ever in Tears of the Kingdom,
          especially because of the game‚Äôs new <b>Fuse</b> system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gone are the days where there are seperate arrows like fire, ice, and
          so on. Now, you can attach virtually any material to an arrow to
          produce useful (and useless) effects ‚Äì to freeze enemies from afar,
          detonate exploding barrels, or set up a well-positioned light source
          in a dark area. Experiment with everything. It‚Äôs fun!
        </p>

        <p>
          BUT this means that you will be using a lot of arrows, for various
          functions. So make sure you get in the habit of diligently collecting
          arrows from battlefields and boxes early on, to make sure you never
          run out. At one point in the late game, we had over 100 arrows, which
          quickly diminished to zero at a time when they were badly needed.
          Avoid this at all costs!
        </p>

        <h1>3. Remember you can throw your materials</h1>

        </div>
        <p>
          This tip is related to the last one. You‚Äôre going to use a lot of
          different materials for different purposes in
          <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>. You‚Äôll need to burn away spiky foliage,
          light up paths, and blow up rocky passages. The easiest way to do this
          is to attach materials to an arrow and let it loose. But as mentioned
          in the previous tips, arrows are very important!
        </p>

        <p>
          So, if you need to unleash an effect in a location that isn‚Äôt very far
          away, try to remember you can simply throw the item (Hold R1, then
          press Up on the D-Pad to replace your weapon with an item). Take a
          leaf out of the survival horror genre, and save your arrows for when
          you‚Äôre <i>really</i> going to need them!

          4. You will be able to trade your hearts for stamina, and vice versa

        <p>
          As you gradually complete more Shrines in <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>,
          you‚Äôll earn Light of Blessing orbs, which you can trade for additional
          hearts of life, or a longer stamina bar, at the Goddess Statues you
          find around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should do what you think will be of most benefit to you, of
          course.
          <b
            >But there will come a point in the game where you won‚Äôt be able to
            progress the main story without a certain amount of hearts, and
            another point where you won‚Äôt be able to progress without a certain
            amount of stamina.</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Thankfully, you will eventually discover a statue in Hyrule‚Äôs central
          base of operations, Lookout Landing, that will allow you to trade
          hearts for stamina, and vice versa ‚Äì there will be an event when one
          of the workers is spooked by a voice coming from inside the wall.
